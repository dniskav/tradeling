tradeling test

Hi this is the github search app.

- I used TS, Redux, thunk, and the common reactjs app stuff.
- I tried to use react-persist but I got a lot of types errors and was difficult to fix it, then I decided to use other way to persist the redux store.
(I think this is a plus of a developer, not to get stuck)
- I put i18n with 'en' and 'es' because I think is necessary to be able to be understood by different users.
- I put unit test too, basic test.
- you need to update the token on `.env` file because github block the token when I pushed the file.

The app is located on tradeling-app folder, and to setup it you must run `npm install`.
